# Tesla Notifier
I want to buy a Tesla, but the demo cars appear to be a lot more affordable.
Issue is, the demo vehicles tend to sell pretty quickly.

So, I figured this was an opportunity to do two things:

- Automate the process of checking for new demo vehicles, or new demo vehicle prices.
- Get to play with GitHub actions as a CI/CD option.

If you want to run this too, you'll need to set the action secrets variables in your own repository and also potentially update the AWS region in the `main.yml` GitHub Actions file.
